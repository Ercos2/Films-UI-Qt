# Films-UI-Qt

This project helps to organize movies for future viewing or already viewed.
The project has a windowed interface.

There are 3 buttons on the initial window:
* 1. Displays the unseen movies that have been made, reminding the user that he has made and has not yet watched

* 2. Change the viewing status. Allows you to mark the movie as viewed (so that it is not displayed in the first paragraph) or not viewed (so that it is displayed in the first paragraph)

* 3. Making new movies. Allows you to specify the title, genre in the drop-down list and the viewing status (viewed or not viewed)

The project is based on SQLite and Qt libraries.
Most of the program runs on smart pointers to avoid possible memory loss
